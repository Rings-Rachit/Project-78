                Hi! Welcome to my family page. Here, you'll see who the Srivastavas are and a little about us. <br> <hr><br>
                <p> Starting off, we have me! The maker of this webpage, Rachit! I'm a 12 year old learning to code. Coming up next,
                     you'll see my mother, or mummy, Richa! She is a nice mom who cooks great food and is nice to be around.
                     After her, you'll get a clear view of my father, or papa, Amit! He's a tall man, towering over me. He's a nice person 
                     who nice to have company with, much like me and my mother! And last, but not least - the oddball of the group... 
                     my younger brother. Unlike us, he's can be very stubborn, is a crybaby frankly, and can get on your nerves sometimes. 
                     But, when he's not like this, he can be a decent fellow, so I'll give him that. 
                </p>
